#Game Description

Snake is a classic phone game where the player controls a snake and eats fruits spawning randomly throughout the map to grow. To win the game the snake needs to occupy the entirety of the map without hitting the map’s border head on or hitting itself, which kills it. The snake walks with each tick of the game.
Our game is basically snake but the player gets the option to play it in hard mode, where randomly generated walls with the same particularities of the borders of the map appear, the fruits move randomly and the speed of the game is higher. The player also has the option to create his own maps, adding walls and shaping the map as the player wants.
A easier mode is also an option, where the map is smaller and the speed of the game is slower than normal (a said number of fruits to be eaten could also be an option)

#Implemented Features

“Face up”: if the snake wasn’t going down beforehand, it will face up if the up key or the w key is pressed; //at the moment there is no constraints for the movement

“Face down”: if the snake wasn’t going up beforehand, it will face down if the down key or the s key is pressed; //at the moment there is no constraints for the movement

“Face right”: if the snake wasn’t going left beforehand, it will face right if the right key or the d key is pressed; //at the moment there is no constraints for the movement

“Face left”: if the snake wasn’t going right beforehand, it will face left if the left key or the a key is pressed; //at the moment there is no constraints for the movement

“Eat fruits”: when the head of the snake is on the same block as a fruit, the snake eats it;

“Snake collision”: if the snake collides with the border, itself or a wall it dies; //only collision with border was added

“Close menu”: closes the menu if the e key is pressed; //at the moment game closes
